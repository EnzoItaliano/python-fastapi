This example of Todo App was created by BekBrace and improved by me while studying FastAPI.

I had to change some things in frontend and backend because of the newer versions of the packages BekBrace used in his tutorial and I also did improvements in the behavior of the components of the frontend.

This was my first time working with FastAPI.
